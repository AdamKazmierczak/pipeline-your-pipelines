# Meta-pipelines - Part 6 - Organising

## Multiple hosts for the same Platform
TODO
The check for running container works for a single host!
There is no load balancing!
Strategies:
1. Run all agent flavours on all hosts
2. Use Capabilities to partition and organise your agent within a platform.
3. Stop managing your Hosts and use Kubernetes

## Running builds
TODO
Wait for any running build to finish before nuking the container
